WELCOME TO WASTELESSLAB REPOSITORY

THIS PROJECT MAIN PURPOSE IS TO REDUCE WASTE FROM MARBLE STONE. EVERYONE THAT NEED TO USE MARBLE STONE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT EVERY SLAB WONT BE A PERFECT SQUARE-SHAPE SLAB. THEREFORE WASTE IS INEVITABLE, AS NATURAL AS IT SHOULD BE. 

THIS IS A SIMPLE PROJECT TO DETERMINED MAXIMUM AREA USEABLE FROM A SLAB TO BE TURN INTO A PERFECT SQUARE-SHAPE SLAB. NO MATTER WHAT IT'S SIZE, WHICH SIDE IS SLOOPING OR HOW BIG THE SLOP IS, THIS APP WILL DETERMINE THE NEW LENGTH AND WIDTH FOR YOU TO GET HIGHER POSSIBLE AREA OF A SQUARE.

REQUIREMENT : STANDARIZED DISTRIBUTED MEASUREMENT(SEE FIG1.JPG)
